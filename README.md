# PaintApp

## Description:
A simple paint app which lets the user draw digitally. The consumer can sketch anywhere from few simple scribbles to a possible masterpiece which is homogenous to DaVinci's level of paintings. 

## Contributors: 
Hasham – roles: lead graphic designer, and leading developer.
Tahmid – roles: developer and responsible for the meeting logs.
Nikolas – developer 
Areeb – roles: Q A tester and graphic designer
Inspiration:
The primary motivation behind this app comes from the paint app, which comes pre-bundled with the user’s Windows OS.  

## Features: 
The main features are as follows: users can draw simple shapes like a circle, square and as well as draw polygons starting from a triangle to a complex polygon with an nth number of sides. Also, able to scribble, and if the user wants to change up some parts of his/her drawing, then he/she can do so by directly using the eraser feature. Then there are the small features that give detail to the drawn picture; the elements follow as such: the ability to choose colours, the user can also change the size of the stroke, and finally, can fill in shape to make his/her drawing even more beautiful.

## Skills Acquired: 
To highlight the skills gained from this project are the use of design patterns which not only helped us the developers but whoever was testing this software. Also, we followed up with industries best practice; to manage our project and increase our performance we used the Scrum methodology. 

## Problems Faced: 
Initially started off the project by following the waterfall methodology, which in layman terms it is linearly coding until documentation has been developed and then testing at the end of the project and then finding bugs from the start, which can make the code ugly and hard to follow when compared with the Scrum methodology. So this was a crucial problem with our program, and so instead we went with the new method known as the Scrum.  Scrum in simple words is breaking up the complex project into small modules or bugs to the discussed member from the meetings. Long story short mainly debugging on the way and creating features in small steps and the end, this methodology proved to be a successful way to end off the project.

## Software/tools used: 
Eclipse IDE used to compile java code in, Creating branches via the version control git, discord mainly used for team’s communication.
