	Yesterday :N/A
	
	Today     :Discussed User Stories, ideas for design patterns with group. 
	
	Obstacles :A group member had problems with merge

Nov 5, 2016
	Yesterday :Discussed ideas for code. 
	
	Today     :Added info for user stories, added user stories to sprint backlog. 
			   Worked on Bug 3,4 and 5 (improved model, fixed Squiggle, made factory for shapes).
			   
	Obstacles :Problems with git merging and creating new branches. Had a lot of issues with new branches and merging.

Nov 6, 2016
	Yesterday : Did most of the design aspect (model, factory, squiggle as composite)
	
	Today     : Fixed Bug2: made way to see what current shape mode is. Lots of working/changing how factory works, 
				how shapes are updated as mouse is dragged, how shapes are observable etc. Lots of changes to design.  
				Helped group members with some stuff like factory, Rectangle and GUI. 
				
	Obstacles : Still had a lot of issues with creating branches and merging. It is taking a while to understand it all,
				but we're getting there.
	
Nov 7, 2016
	Yesterday : Fixed Bug 2, made changes with how shape works and how factory works. Helped group members with some stuff. 
	
	Today     : Did User stories 9 and 10. Added the GUI for Line Thickness and implemented the code for Line Thickness. 
				Also changed how GUI looks a bit.
				 
	Obstacles :	Some merge conflicts took time. 
	
Nov 8, 2016
	Yesterday : Worked on line thickness. 
	
	Today     : Discussed with group about redesigning how shapes are created. Implemented redesign for shape creation. Removed modifyShape 
				entirely.  Adjusted factory and paint panel to new design. Also, implemented Polyline by creating a new mouse listener 
				class for it. 
				
	Obstacles : Deciding on design.
	
Nov 9, 2016
	Yesterday : Redesigns for how shape creation, modifyShape and factory works. Created new mouselisteners for polyline.
	
	Today     : Finished up documentation for all classes. Worked on a new shape Polygon. Fixed up issues here and there.
	 
	Obstacles : Donald Trump won the election, which hit me pretty hard.
	
Nov 13, 2016
	Yesterday : N/A
	
	Today     : Did Bug 2.3 and 2.4. Made strategy classes for each of the shapes. Adjusted factory so that it now creates differnet instances 
				of strategy based on the current mode. Made the 2 listener classes that correspond to the strategies. 
	 
	Obstacles : Unsure of how the command pattern should work for painting shapes. We think what we have right now is fine but we aren't sure. 
				Also, not sure if strategies themselves should be listeners or if the listeners should be seperate classes. 
				
Nov 14, 2016
	Yesterday : Did Bug 2.3 and 2.4
	
	Today     : Improved Bug 2.4 so that now the strategy classes implement listeners by themselves. Also, adjusted factory to new design of 
				strategy classes. Also, worked on feedback for polygon and polyline.
	 
	Obstacles : Again, deciding if strategy classes implement listeners or not took a while to determine.
	
Nov 15, 2016
	Yesterday : Redid Bug 2.4 and worked on polygon/polyline
	
	Today     : Removed unused code and code that was commented out. Made code cleaner. Creassted selection for shapes. Now shapes can be selected 
				and moved around. Implemented selection for Rectangle,Square,Squiggle,Circle so far. Made it so Eraser can't be selected and moved.
				
	 
	Obstacles : Determining if a click is inside of a shape is difficult for some cases.
	
Nov 16, 2016
	Yesterday : Did ShapeSelector. 
	
	Today     : Implemented ShapeSelector for Polygon and Polyline. Used referenced code for some of the click issues. Maded it so user 
				can change the graphical attributes of a shape after selecting it. Implemented Copy, Paste and Cut for selected Shape. 
				Added New and Clear implementation. Fixed the Polyline/Polygon selection SEVERAL TIMES. SEVERAL. OH GOD, SO MANY TIMES.
				Fixed bugs found along the way. Made it so right click deselects shape. 
	 
	Obstacles : Polygon and Polyline Selection. Lots of trial and error. Deciding on how packages should be.
